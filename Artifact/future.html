							<h3>The Future of World Wide Web</h3>
						</div>
						<img class="featureImg" src="http://www.areta.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/freshizer/web_tasarim.jpg" width="100%" height="300px">
						<p>Much progress has been made about the web and related technologies in the past two decades ever since its introduction by Tim Burners-Lee in 1989. </p>

						<div><img class="insertedImg" src="image/future_of_web.jpg">
							<h6>Fig 1 Future of the Web</h6></div>

						<h4><strong>Web 1.0</strong></h4>
						<div>
							<p>It is the 1st generation of the World Wide Web which was proposed by Tim Burners-Lee. Web 1.0 is one-way broadcasting means that only the owner of the site can publish information and people are only able to read from the internet thus made Web 1.0 as the read-only web. The early web provided a limited user interactions or content distribution and only allowed to search for information and read it. This is the first phase of linking web pages and hyperlink.</p>
						</div>
						<h4><strong>Web 2.0</strong></h4>
						<div>
							<p>It is the 2nd generation of the World Wide Web, officially defined by Dale Dougherty in 2004, that mainly focused on the ability for people to collaborate and share information online. The technologies of web 2.0 allow assembling and managing large global crowds with common interest in social interactions. It signifies a conversation between the original author of the content and all those who can participate. Web 2.0 refers to the transition of form static HTML web pages to a more dynamic HTML or dynamic web.</p>
							<p>Web 2.0 is not only a new version of web 1.0, features like flexible web design, creative reuse, updates, collaborative content creation and modification are all facilitated through web 2.0. One of the most distinct feature of web 2.0 is to support collaboration and to help gather collective information/intelligence rather than the earlier version. </p>
							<p>The main technologies and services of web 2.0 include blogs, really simple syndication (RSS), wikis, mashups, tags, folksonomy and so on.</p>
						</div>
						<h4><strong>Web 3.0</strong></h4>
						<div>
							<p>Web 3.0 a.k.a the Semantic Web is an exciting evolution of the World Wide Web (the Web) which aims to decrease human's tasks and decision making mechanism by providing <i>machine-readable</i> and <i>machine-comprehensible</i> information far beyond current capabilities. This idea was suggested by John Markoff from New York Times back in 2006. The basic idea behind web 3.0 is to define structure data and link them in order to more effective discovery, automation, integration and reuse accross different applications.</p>
							<div><img class="insertedImg" src="image/w3.jpg"></div>
							<h6>Fig 2 How Web 3.0 works in a nutshell</h6>
							<p>Furthermore, web 3.0 tries to link, integrate and analyze data from various data sets to obtain new information stream. With semantic Web it helps computer understand the meaning behind the web page, changing the web into a language that can be read and categorized by the system rather than human. Nonetheless, the main important purpose of semantic web is to make the web readable by machines not only by humans. In short, Web 3.0 extracting meaning from the way people interact with the web. </p>
							<p>The main difference between web 2.0 and web 3.0 is that web 2.0 focuses on content creativity of users and producers while web 3.0 targets on linked data sets. Semantic web was thought up by Tim Burner-Lee, the original inventor of world wide web. There is a dedicated team at World Wide Web Consorsium (W3C) working to improve, extend and standardize the system, languages and publications tools have already been developed. Tim Berners-Lee proposed a layered architecture for semantic web that often represented using a diagram, with many variations ever since.</p>
							<p>Berners-Lee also introduced a set of rules which have become known as the Linked Data principles to publish and connect data on the web in 2007. Data providers can add their data to a single global data space by publishing data on the web according to these principles.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Use URIs as names for things</li>
								<li>Use HTTP URIs to look up those names</li>
								<li>Provide useful information, using the standards (RDF, SPARQL) by look up a URI</li>
								<li>Include links to other URIs to discover more things</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
						<h4><strong>Web 4.0</strong></h4>
						<div>
							<p>Web 4.0, a.k.a symbiotic web, happened where human and machine can interact in symbiosis like mind controlled interfaces. However, it is still an underground idea in progress. It will be possible to build more powerful interfaces such as mind controlled interface using web 4.0. To put it simply, machines would be clever on reading contents of the web and react in the form of executing and deciding what to execute first to load the website fast with superior quality and performance. Web 4.0 will be such as a middleware in which start functioning like an operating system. The web 4.0 will be parallel to the human brain and implies a massive web of highly intelligent interactions.</p>
							<p>Although there have not been any exact technology and tools available yet, but it is obvious that the web is moving toward using artificial intelligence.</p>
